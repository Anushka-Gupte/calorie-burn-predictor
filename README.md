# Calorie Burn Predictor — Estimate Calories Burned from Workouts

Calorie Burn Predictor is a lightweight machine learning project that estimates how many calories a user burned during a workout based on input features. It includes an easy-to-use Streamlit web app for interactive inference and friendly feedback messages based on the predicted calorie burn.

The app is designed for rapid experimentation and demo—useful for fitness apps, recovery guidance, or as a learning project.
